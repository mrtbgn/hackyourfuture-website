          <h2>Aaron Swartz</h2>
          <p>
            Aaron Swartz, American computer programmer and Internet activist
            (born Nov. 8, 1986, Chicago, Ill.—died Jan. 11, 2013, New York,
            N.Y.), was regarded by many as a programming wizard who led a
            crusade to make information on the Internet freely available to all.
            At the age of 14, Swartz helped develop the RSS format, an automated
            system for delivering information from frequently updated sources.
            He contributed to the Creative Commons copyright system and to the
            Semantic Web. He later founded a company, Infogami, that in 2005
            merged with and formed the basic architecture for the social-sharing
            site Reddit. In 2008 Swartz wrote a program to download federal
            judicial documents from the Public Access to Court Electronic
            Records (PACER) database in order to make them freely available and
            circumvent the fee that PACER required. In 2011 he undertook to make
            the academic journals accessible for a fee from JSTOR freely
            available; at the time of his death, by suicide, Swartz was under
            federal indictment for illegally accessing and distributing that
            material.

          <h2>Robert Tabban Morris</h2>
          <p>
            Robert Tappan Morris (born November 8, 1965) is an American computer
            scientist and entrepreneur. He is best known for creating the Morris
            Worm in 1988, considered the first computer worm on the Internet.
            Morris was prosecuted for releasing the worm, and became the first
            person convicted under the then-new Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He
            went on to co-found the online store Viaweb, one of the first
            web-based applications, and later the funding firm Y Combinator—both
            with Paul Graham. He later joined the faculty in the department of
            Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology, where he received tenure in 2006. He was
            elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 2019.

          <h2>Tim Berners-Lee</h2>
          <p>
            Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He is the
            Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), a Web standards
            organization founded in 1994 which develops interoperable
            technologies (specifications, guidelines, software, and tools) to
            lead the Web to its full potential. He is a Director of the World
            Wide Web Foundation which was launched in 2009 to coordinate efforts
            to further the potential of the Web to benefit humanity. A graduate
            of Oxford University, Sir Tim invented the Web while at CERN, the
            European Particle Physics Laboratory, in 1989. He wrote the first
            web client and server in 1990. His specifications of URIs, HTTP and
            HTML were refined as Web technology spread. He is the 3Com Founders
            Professor of Engineering in the School of Engineering with a joint
            appointment in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer
            Science at the Laboratory for Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence ( CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
            (MIT) where he co-leads the Decentralized Information Group (DIG).
            The Decentralized Information Group, works on the Solid Project to
            give people control of their own data and to re-decentralize the
            Web. He is the co-founder and CTO of inrupt, the company launched to
            ensure the success of the Solid platform and its open source
            community, and to build the ecosystem that supports it. He is also a
            Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of
            Oxford, UK. He is President of and founded the Open Data Institute
            in London. In 2011 he was named to the Board of Trustees of the Ford
            Foundation, a globally oriented private foundation with the mission
            of advancing human welfare. He is President of London's Open Data
            Institute. In 2001 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. He has
            been the recipient of several international awards including the
            Japan Prize, the Prince of Asturias Foundation Prize, the Millennium
            Technology Prize and Germany's Die Quadriga award. In 2004 he was
            knighted by H.M. Queen Elizabeth and in 2007 he was awarded the
            Order of Merit. In 2009 he was elected a foreign associate of the
            National Academy of Sciences. He is the author of "Weaving the Web".
            On March 18 2013, Sir Tim, along with Vinton Cerf, Robert Kahn,
            Louis Pouzin and Marc Andreesen, was awarded the Queen Elizabeth
            Prize for Engineering for "ground-breaking innovation in engineering
            that has been of global benefit to humanity." Sir Tim has promoted
            open government data globally and spend time fighting for rights
            such as net neutrality, privacy and the openness of the Web. On 4
            April 2017, Sir Tim was awarded the ACM A.M. Turing Prize for
            inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the
            fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale. The
            Turing Prize, called the "Nobel Prize of Computing" is considered
            one of the most prestigious awards in Computer Science.

          <h2>Steve Jobs</h2>
          <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and entrepreneur
            who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple
            Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include the iPod,
            iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution of modern
            technology. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate
            students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but
            directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with
            different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in
            1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation
            Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs died
            in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.
